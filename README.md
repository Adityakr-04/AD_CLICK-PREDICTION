The goal is to predict if a user would click on an advertisement based on the features of the user.
Few assumptions made as a part of this project is: 

1)	User taken into consideration are between the age group of 19 to 61. 
2)	There is almost equal ratio of male and female internet users. 
3)	The ad topic is limited to what is given in the dataset. 

### Challenges Faced:

We are highly motivated to work on Ad click prediction dataset, few challenges in this area of study is:

1)	New online ads that are coming up is not targeted to a particular set of users, using our prediction algorithm study companies will be able to target it to particular set of users.


### Data Set

The dataset consists of below features:

Daily Time Spent on Site: consumer time on site in minutes

Age: Customer age in years

Area Income: Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer

Daily Internet Usage: Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet

Ad Topic Line: Headline of the advertisement

City: City of consumer

Male: Whether or not consumer was male

Country: Country of consumer

We have done preliminary EDA(mention below) and we are planning to do more insight as we progress.


### Conclusion 

Comparing all the above implementation models, we conclude that Decision Trees Algorithm gives us the maximum accuracy for determining the click  probability. We believe in future there will be fewer ads, but they will be more relevant. And also these ads will cost more and will be worth it.
